# CarInfoLookupAPI
This is the place where i will be putting the information about the car look up api that i am making, this data is currently under development. 

For now, you can use the link [https://carlookup.server.thomasdye.net/](https://carlookup.server.thomasdye.net/) to try it out and start adding to the DB. 

The API will be free, and will provide all the same information that we do on the web, however right now I am trying to build out the DB and I think the quickest way it to create this web page, that you can use. 
I hope people find this intresting. 

There is no private data here, all data is public in one form or another. I will no doute add to the keys and that over time. 
I have already build some code that will work out with relative accuracy what the type is, eg police car etc.
